    OURrestroom is a project conceived by Kristin Russo. After feeling
    frustrated by the many businesses she patroned that gendered their
    single-stall restrooms, she decided to do something about it.
    <br>
    Speaking with some small business owners, she found that lack of
    education about the benefits of gender-non-specific, single-stall
    restrooms was often the reasoning behind many business restroom
    policies. These discussions helped inform how OURrestroom would be built.
    <br>
    Providing anonymity to users and contacting business owners in a non-
    confrontational manner are integral features of the OURrestroom project.
    Business patrons want to feel as though they are being heard, but may
    not feel comfortable confronting business owners face-to-face. OURrestroom
    offers a space for users to be a part of a movement without the risks involved
    in in-person confrontation.

##One of the most insidious and common forms of harmful policies are a result of misinformation or ignorance to the experience of those personally affected.


#APPROACH

In the wake of several state-wide laws that have recently been passed barring 
LGBTQ nondiscrimination ordinances:

> The measure revokes local gay and trans nondiscrimination ordinances throughout the state, 
> effectively legalizing anti-LGBTQ discrimination, and forbids trans people from using the 
> bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. That includes trans public school students, 
> many of whom will now, in effect, be barred from using the bathroom at school.

Our Restroom is an application that provides businesses that have single-stall, gendered restrooms
the necessary information to change their policy regarding gendered bathrooms. Patrons may not feel comfortable or equipped to approach business managers or owners, so we take the responsibility for getting in touch and informing them of the many reasons for unisex bathrooms. 

Policies like the one recently passed in North Carolina not only affect gender-nonconforming
people, but also parents of children of the opposite gender: what happens to children who
need help in the bathroom? What about caretakes of people with disabilities? Elderly people who 
assistance in the restroom? 
These are all scenarios to consider when local businesses create spaces that will cater
to and make all of their patrons comfortable.

##Kroger has the right idea:

The goal is to create a user-generated database that will store business information
and reach out to these business via postal mail, email, and potentially via social 
media such as Twitter.
